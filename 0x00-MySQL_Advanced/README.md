# 0x00-MySQL Advanced

Welcome to the `0x00-MySQL_Advanced` directory. This project focuses on advanced SQL concepts and optimizations. Below are the details for each file included in this directory.

The `0-create_table.sql` file contains the SQL commands to create the `users` and `scores` tables, which are fundamental for storing user information and their respective scores in the database.

The `1-insert.sql` file is responsible for inserting sample data into the `users` and `scores` tables. This is essential for testing queries and ensuring that the database has data to work with.

In `2-select.sql`, a selection query retrieves all users from the `users` table, allowing for easy data verification and manipulation in subsequent queries.

The `3-join.sql` file demonstrates how to use SQL joins to combine data from the `users` and `scores` tables. This file showcases the ability to gather related information across multiple tables, which is crucial for more complex queries.

In `4-aggregate.sql`, aggregate functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, and `AVG` are utilized to analyze data within the `scores` table, providing insights into user performance and statistics.

The `5-index.sql` file introduces indexing concepts by creating indexes on the `scores` table. This optimization technique enhances query performance and reduces search time when retrieving records.

The `6-views.sql` file contains the definition of views, which are virtual tables based on the result set of a stored query. Views simplify complex queries by allowing users to interact with them as if they were actual tables.

In `7-procedures.sql`, stored procedures are implemented to encapsulate SQL code for reuse. This file demonstrates how to create and call procedures for executing complex business logic on the database server.

The `8-functions.sql` file defines user-defined functions to extend SQL capabilities. Functions can be called within queries, providing more flexibility and modularity in SQL scripts.

The `9-optimizations.sql` file presents various optimization techniques for enhancing SQL query performance. This includes rewriting queries for better efficiency and analyzing execution plans.

Finally, `10-examples.sql` provides practical examples showcasing the application of the concepts discussed throughout this directory. This file serves as a reference for how to implement advanced SQL techniques in real-world scenarios.

Each file is designed to build on the previous concepts, enabling users to deepen their understanding of MySQL and its advanced features.
